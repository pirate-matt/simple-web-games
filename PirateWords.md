_Can you guess the captain's favorite word before you walk the plank?_

## Ideation

* Variable length of plank based on size of word.
* Easy, Medium, Spicy modes.
* What about phrases?
* How about creating levels?
* Include some fun fact about word/phrase upon completion?
* How about categories of guesses?
* Is there a free API I can used to update the words every month, day, week, etc.?
  * What about using GitHub actions to automate this build?
